# Email Templates with Powershell scripting
Email template example. Email templates are done with HTML, and inline styles with CSS2 its tedious and old school. 
Due to the various emial providers this project shows how to make styles and images display on all email platforms inlcuding outlook, gmail, yahoo etc.
They are done so with tags to represent each email provider to render specifically for that provider. 
I have a powershell script that dynamically generates the header title, footer, and speficic color for the particular template/notifiacton. 
Note that you can change the variables and information to be generated within he DynamicText.ps1 file.
